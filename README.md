# GPPMM
Implementation of Gaussian Process Panel Modeling in Matlab

# Note

While all major functionality is available, this package is still in a rather early stage. For example, documentation is still incomplete and the package will soon probably undergo major API changes. Its current purpose is mainly to enable reachers familiar with Matlab to experiment with the new panel modeling technique Gaussian Process Panel Modeling. 

The recommended approach to learn about the functionality of the package is currently to closely follow the example provided. This is described in the following.


# Installtion

## Prerequisites

GPML (http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/) needs to be installed first. Instead of the current version, please install version 3.6.


## Installation

Download all files and make sure that the main folder is included in you Matlab path.

# Example

The example in examples/demoGPPM.m demonstrates all major functions and how they are typically used.
